CS 450: Intro to Computer Graphics  
Final Project – Fall 2024

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a 3D flower garden built using **OpenGL** for my CS450 final. The scene features custom-modeled flowers, a grass-textured grid, a dynamically animated sunlight source, and a hopping bunny to bring the environment to life. It combines everything I learned throughout the term—geometry, animation, lighting, texturing, and rendering techniques—into one cohesive visual experience.

## 🌼 Final Features

- **4 unique 3D flowers**, created using cylinders and spheres for stems, petals, and centers
- **Custom garden layout** using a grid textured to look like grass
- **Animated sunlight** that moves across the garden, using lighting transformations
- **Hopping bunny animation** added using an imported `.obj` file for extra movement and character
- **Material shading and coloring** using `setMaterial()` and color management
- **OBJ file handling** and dynamic scene composition using `glPushMatrix`, `glPopMatrix`, and `glTranslatef`

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **OpenGL** (GLUT, GLU)
- **C++**
- **OBJ file loader**
- **Custom 3D geometry modeling**
- **Texture mapping and material shading**
